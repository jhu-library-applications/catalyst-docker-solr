# A synonym file for solr SynonymFilterFactory that contains certain
# punctuation-including terms we want to whitelist protect and make
# searchable. We do this by mapping them to tokens that
# do not include punctuation, and including a SynonymFilter pointing
# to this file BEFORE the WordDelimiterFilterFactory that removes punctuation.
#
# Needs to be included at both index and query time eg:
#  <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="punctuation-whitelist.txt" ignoreCase="true"/>



# computer language. 

c++ => cplusplus

# c# and f# are computer languages as well as key signatures,
# others are key signatures. We started out motivated by computer
# languages, but since that hit some key signatures, do the rest
# for consistency. 
# We map both from number-sign (#) and musical sharp (♯)

A#, A♯ => asharp
B#, B♯ => bsharp
C#, C♯ => csharp
D#, D♯ => dsharp
E#, E♯ => esharp
F#, F♯ => fsharp
G#, G♯ => gsharp

# j sharp is a computer language
j#, j♯ => jsharp

# Do the flat key signatures for consistency, since we did the sharps.
# We do NOT map input ascii "b" symbol that looks like a flat, since that
# will end up catching actual words like "Ab" (latin), and the consequences
# are unclear to me now.
#
# However, we do map _to_ the ascii representation -- this means if someone
# enters either "A♭" OR "Ab" as a search, it'll find "a♭" either way, 
# since that was indexed as "ab".  It'll also find actual "Ab" in source, either
# way, for better or worse. 

A♭    => Ab
B♭    => Bb
C♭    => Cb
D♭    => Db
E♭    => Eb
F♭    => Fb
G♭    => Gb
